# FastSAM Selection Modes Guide üéØ

## 3 Ways to Isolate Specific Objects

FastSAM can now detect **specific objects** instead of everything in the scene. Choose the mode that fits your use case:

---

## **Mode 1: Largest Object** ‚≠ê (Recommended)

**Best for:** Robot cells where the product is the biggest object.

```yaml
Selection Mode: largest
```

**How it works:**
- FastSAM detects everything
- Returns ONLY the largest object
- Ignores small debris, tools, background

**Use cases:**
- ‚úÖ Picking up main product (ignoring small parts)
- ‚úÖ Quality inspection of primary item
- ‚úÖ Single-product robot cells

**Example:**
```
Scene: Large bottle + small screws + wrench
Result: Only the bottle is detected
```

---

## **Mode 2: Center Region** ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Best for fixed cells)

**Best for:** Fixed robot workspace with defined work area.

```yaml
Selection Mode: center_region
Center Region %: 50
```

**How it works:**
- Defines a center region (e.g., 50% of frame)
- Only detects objects with center point in that region
- Darkens edges to show excluded area

**Use cases:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed robot cell with work area
- ‚úÖ Ignore objects at frame edges
- ‚úÖ Focus on conveyor belt center

**Visual feedback:**
- Yellow box shows center region
- Outside area is darkened (excluded)

**Example:**
```
Scene: Products on belt + boxes on sides
Result: Only products in center 50% detected
```

---

## **Mode 3: Point Click** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Most flexible)

**Best for:** Variable scenes, manual selection, or teaching mode.

```yaml
Selection Mode: point_click
```

**How it works:**
- FastSAM detects everything (background)
- User clicks on desired object (or robot calculates center)
- Returns ONLY the clicked object

**Use cases:**
- ‚úÖ Multiple similar products (choose which one)
- ‚úÖ Teaching mode (user shows which to pick)
- ‚úÖ Variable scenes
- ‚úÖ Interactive debugging

**Visual feedback:**
- Yellow crosshair at click point
- Yellow circle around click

**Example:**
```
Scene: 3 identical bottles
User clicks: Middle bottle
Result: Only middle bottle detected
```

---

## **Mode 4: All Objects** (Default)

**Best for:** Counting, inventory, or general detection.

```yaml
Selection Mode: all
```

**How it works:**
- Detects everything in scene
- Returns all objects above size threshold

**Use cases:**
- ‚úÖ Count objects on conveyor
- ‚úÖ Inventory checking
- ‚úÖ Multiple-object tasks

## GUI Configuration

### Step 1: Open Vision Settings
```
Settings ‚Üí Vision Tab ‚Üí Select FastSAM Segmentation ‚ö°
```

### Step 2: Configure Selection Mode

**For "Largest Object" mode:**
```
Selection Mode: largest
Min Object Size: 500 (adjust based on product)
Max Object Size: 50000
```

**For "Center Region" mode:**
```
Selection Mode: center_region
Center Region %: 50 (adjust to your workspace)
Min Object Size: 500
```

**For "Point Click" mode:**
```
Selection Mode: point_click
(Click on object during testing or operation)
```

### Step 3: Test It
Click **"Test Vision Camera"** to see live detection with your mode!

## Comparison Table

| Mode | Speed | Flexibility | Setup | Best For |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Largest** | ‚ö° Fastest | üîí Fixed | None | Single main product |
| **Center Region** | ‚ö° Fast | üîí Fixed | Define region | Fixed workspace |
| **Point Click** | ‚ö° Fast | ‚ú® Flexible | Click object | Variable scenes |
| **All** | ‚ö° Fast | ‚ú® Flexible | None | Counting/inventory |

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Beauty Product Cell
**Scenario:** Robot picks up lipstick from tray. Small caps and tools nearby.

**Solution:** `selection_mode: largest`
- Lipstick is biggest object
- Caps and tools ignored automatically
- No configuration needed

---

### Example 2: Conveyor Belt Inspection
**Scenario:** Products move through center of frame. Boxes stacked at edges.

**Solution:** `selection_mode: center_region` + `center_region_percent: 60`
- Only products in center 60% detected
- Edge boxes ignored
- Visual confirmation with overlay

---

### Example 3: Multi-Product Teaching
**Scenario:** 5 different bottles. Operator teaches which to pick.

**Solution:** `selection_mode: point_click`
- Operator clicks on correct bottle during teaching
- Robot remembers approximate position
- During replay, clicks same position automatically
- Handles small position variations

---

## Advanced: Dynamic Mode Switching

You can change modes **without restarting** the model:

```python
# In your code
detector.selection_mode = "largest"  # Switch to largest
result = detector.detect(frame)

detector.selection_mode = "center_region"  # Switch to center
detector.center_region_percent = 40.0
result = detector.detect(frame)
```

## Wide-Angle Lens (135¬∞) Note üì∑

**Q: Do I need to calibrate my wide-angle lens?**

**A: Probably not** - Test first:
1. Place product at **edge** of frame
2. Run FastSAM
3. Check if mask looks good

‚úÖ **Mask looks good?** ‚Üí No calibration needed  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Mask warped at edges?** ‚Üí Calibration would help

**Most 135¬∞ lenses work fine without calibration** for segmentation. You'd mainly need it for:
- Precise measurements
- Extreme fisheye (180¬∞+)
- Robotic arm coordinate calculations

---

## Troubleshooting

### "It picks the wrong object"
- **Mode: largest** ‚Üí Ensure your product is actually the largest, or use center_region
- **Mode: center_region** ‚Üí Adjust center_region_percent to match your workspace
- **Mode: point_click** ‚Üí Verify click coordinates are on the desired object

### "It detects too many objects"
- Increase `min_object_size` to filter small detections
- Use `selection_mode: largest` or `center_region` to focus

### "It's too slow"
- Use `model_size: small` (not large)
- Lower `frequency_hz` to 2-3 FPS
- Reduce `min_object_size` to skip tiny objects faster

### "Center region not visible"
- Ensure `selection_mode: center_region` is set
- Check `center_region_percent` is between 10-90

---

## Performance

All modes run at **~18 FPS on CPU** (same speed):
- Detection: ~130-180ms
- Selection filtering: <1ms (negligible)

**No speed penalty** for using selection modes!

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Try `largest` mode first (easiest)
2. ‚úÖ If that doesn't work, try `center_region`
3. ‚úÖ For complex scenes, use `point_click`
4. ‚úÖ Train YOLO on your specific products for production
