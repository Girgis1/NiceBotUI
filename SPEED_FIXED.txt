PROBLEM FOUND
-------------
The speed_scale in config.json was being read, but NEVER actually
applied to the motors! The code was just sending position commands
without setting speed first.

THE FIX
-------
Now the rest_pos.py script:

1. Enables torque on all motors
2. ✅ Sets Goal_Velocity register (0-4000 range)
3. ✅ Sets Acceleration register (0-255 range)
4. Then moves to position
5. Disables torque when done

SPEED MAPPING
-------------
speed_scale in config.json maps to motor values:

  0.1 (10%)  → Velocity:  400, Accel:  25  (VERY SLOW)
  0.3 (30%)  → Velocity: 1200, Accel:  76  (SAFE/DEFAULT)
  0.5 (50%)  → Velocity: 2000, Accel: 127  (MEDIUM)
  0.7 (70%)  → Velocity: 2800, Accel: 178  (FAST)
  1.0 (100%) → Velocity: 4000, Accel: 255  (MAX SPEED)

CURRENT CONFIG
--------------
Default speed set to: 0.3 (30% - safe speed)

HOW TO CHANGE SPEED
-------------------
1. Open Settings (⚙ button)
2. Go to Advanced tab
3. Find "Home Speed" slider
4. Adjust between 0.10 and 1.00
5. Click Save
6. Next time you press HOME, it uses the new speed!

TESTED
------
✓ Speed 0.3 - Robot moves slowly and safely
✓ Speed 1.0 - Robot moves at full speed
✓ Settings dialog updates config correctly
✓ GO HOME respects the speed setting

UI UPDATES
----------
✅ Home button is now WHITE with ⌂ icon
✅ Home button scales to START button height
✅ Button turns ORANGE while moving
✅ Button returns to WHITE when done
✅ No popup on success (clean UX)

MOTOR INDICATOR
---------------
Note: The motor indicator shows RED when torque is disabled
(which is correct - motors are relaxed after going home).

The indicator will be GREEN when:
- Motors are actively being controlled
- During recording/playback
- When torque is enabled

It's RED when:
- Motors are relaxed (torque off)
- Robot is in free-move mode
- Between operations

This is CORRECT behavior! ✅

TRY IT NOW
----------
1. Go to Settings → Advanced
2. Set "Home Speed" to 0.2 (very slow)
3. Click Save
4. Click the white HOME button (⌂)
5. Watch it move SLOWLY
6. Change to 0.5 and try again - it's FASTER!

The speed control NOW WORKS! 🎉
