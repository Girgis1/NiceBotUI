NEW FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
-------------------------

1. ✅ ONE-LINE STATUS DISPLAY
   - Status, Time, and Position now on ONE horizontal line
   - Cleaner, more compact display
   - Better use of screen space

2. ✅ POLICY CHECKPOINT DROPDOWN
   - Auto-detects all available checkpoints
   - Shows them in a dropdown menu
   - Defaults to "last" or latest checkpoint
   - Click to switch between checkpoints
   - 🔄 Refresh button to rescan

3. ✅ SMART CHECKPOINT SCANNING
   - Automatically finds your training checkpoints
   - Scans: outputs/train/TASK/checkpoints/
   - Lists all folders with pretrained_model
   - Sorts: "last" first, then newest to oldest

4. ✅ EDITABLE IN SETTINGS
   - Full policy path still editable in Settings
   - Change base path, task name, etc.
   - Dropdown updates automatically

POLICY DROPDOWN FEATURES
-------------------------

📂 **What it shows:**
- ✓ last (recommended - always latest)
- 90000 (checkpoint at step 90000)
- 80000 (checkpoint at step 80000)
- 70000 (checkpoint at step 70000)
- etc.

🔄 **How it works:**
1. Scans your policy path for checkpoints folder
2. Lists all checkpoint subdirectories
3. Shows "✓ last" with checkmark for the default
4. Click dropdown to select different checkpoint
5. Auto-saves to config.json

▼ **Dropdown styling:**
- Big touch-friendly (40px height)
- White down arrow on right
- Hover = blue border
- Dark theme matching rest of UI

EXAMPLE PATHS
-------------

If your config has:
```json
"policy": {
  "path": "/home/daniel/lerobot/outputs/train/GrabBlock/checkpoints/80000/pretrained_model"
}
```

The dropdown will scan:
`/home/daniel/lerobot/outputs/train/GrabBlock/checkpoints/`

And show:
```
✓ last
90000
80000  ← Currently selected
70000
60000
```

When you select "90000", it updates to:
`/home/daniel/lerobot/outputs/train/GrabBlock/checkpoints/90000/pretrained_model`

CHANGING POLICY IN SETTINGS
----------------------------

To change the BASE policy path:
1. Click ⚙️ Settings
2. Go to "Policy" tab
3. Edit "Checkpoint Path" to point to different task:
   - `/home/daniel/lerobot/outputs/train/PickPlace/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model`
4. Click Save
5. Dropdown will rescan and show PickPlace checkpoints!

STATUS LINE UPDATE
------------------

**Before:** (3 lines)
```
Idle
Time: 00:00
(no position shown)
```

**After:** (1 line)
```
Idle        Time: 00:00        Position: —
```

Much cleaner! Position info will show during robot movement.

REFRESH BUTTON
--------------

Click the 🔄 button to:
- Rescan checkpoint directory
- Pick up new checkpoints from training
- Update dropdown list

Useful when:
- Training is still running
- You just finished a training run
- You added new checkpoints manually

HOW TO USE
----------

### Normal workflow:
1. Train your model: `lerobot train ...`
2. Checkpoints save to: outputs/train/TASK/checkpoints/
3. Open GUI
4. Dropdown shows all checkpoints automatically!
5. Select "✓ last" to use latest (recommended)
6. Or select specific checkpoint (80000, 90000, etc.)
7. Click START to run policy

### Testing different checkpoints:
1. Click dropdown
2. Select "80000" to test checkpoint 80000
3. Run it, see results
4. Click dropdown again
5. Select "90000" to test checkpoint 90000
6. Compare performance!

### When training completes:
1. Click 🔄 to refresh
2. New checkpoints appear
3. Select latest to test

CHECKPOINT SORTING
------------------

Checkpoints are sorted:
1. "last" always FIRST (✓ marked)
2. Numeric checkpoints in DESCENDING order (newest first)
   - 90000
   - 80000  
   - 70000
3. Non-numeric checkpoints alphabetically

This ensures the latest checkpoint is always at the top!

FALLBACK BEHAVIOR
-----------------

If no checkpoints directory found:
- Dropdown shows: "⚠️ last" (or whatever is in config)
- Dropdown is disabled (grayed out)
- You can still edit full path in Settings

This happens when:
- Policy path doesn't follow standard structure
- Path doesn't exist yet
- Custom policy location

TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------

**Path parsing:**
The scanner navigates UP from your policy path until it finds
a directory named "checkpoints", then scans its children.

Works with:
✓ `outputs/train/TASK/checkpoints/CKPT/pretrained_model`
✓ `/home/USER/lerobot/outputs/train/TASK/checkpoints/CKPT/pretrained_model`
✓ `custom/path/to/checkpoints/CKPT/pretrained_model`

**Validation:**
Only includes folders that contain `pretrained_model` subdirectory.

**Auto-save:**
Selecting a new checkpoint immediately saves to config.json
and prints: "Policy changed to: /path/to/checkpoint"

TRY IT NOW
----------

1. Open the app (running in background)
2. Look for "Trained Policy:" dropdown below status
3. Click the dropdown - see your checkpoints!
4. Select different checkpoint
5. Check terminal for: "Policy changed to: ..."
6. Check config.json - path updated!

Your policy management just got way easier! 🎉
