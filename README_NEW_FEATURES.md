## 🎓 Example Workflows

### **Simple Pick-and-Place**
1. Record position above object → SET
2. Record position at object → SET  
3. Add 2-second delay (for gripper)
4. Record lift position → SET
5. Record place position → SET
6. Save as "PickPlace_v1"
7. PLAY to execute!

### **Complex Sequence**
1. Go to Sequence tab
2. Add action: "PickPlace_v1"
3. Add delay: 1.0 second
4. Add model: "GrabBlock" (25 seconds)
5. Add action: "ReturnHome"
6. Save as "WorkflowDemo"
7. RUN SEQUENCE!

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Name your actions descriptively** (not just "Action1")
2. **Test with low velocity first** (safety!)
3. **Use delays for settling time** (better accuracy)
4. **Save incrementally** (don't lose work)
5. **Loop mode for repetitive tasks** (testing, demos)
