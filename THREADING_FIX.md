# Threading Fix for Model Execution

## 🐛 **Problem**

When running a trained model from the Dashboard, the application crashed with:
```
QThread: Destroyed while thread '' is still running
Aborted (core dumped)
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The `ExecutionWorker` (a QThread) was trying to create another QThread (`RobotWorker`) inside its `run()` method. This created **nested threads**, which Qt doesn't handle well:

```python
# BAD: Nested threads
class ExecutionWorker(QThread):
    def run(self):
        # Inside thread 1
        self.robot_worker = RobotWorker(config)  # Creates thread 2
        self.robot_worker.start()  # Nested thread!
        # When ExecutionWorker finishes, it destroys RobotWorker while still running
```

## ✅ **Solution**

**Separate execution paths:**
- **Models** → Use `RobotWorker` **directly** from Dashboard (no nesting)
- **Recordings/Sequences** → Use `ExecutionWorker` (direct motor control, no threads)

### **Updated Architecture**

```python
# Dashboard decides which worker to use
if execution_type == "model":
    # Direct: Dashboard → RobotWorker
    self.worker = RobotWorker(config)
    self.worker.start()
else:
    # Direct: Dashboard → ExecutionWorker (no nested threads)
    self.execution_worker = ExecutionWorker(config, type, name)
    self.execution_worker.start()
```

## 📝 **Changes Made**

### **1. `tabs/dashboard_tab.py`**

**Added separate execution paths:**
```python
def start_run(self):
    # Parse selection
    execution_type, execution_name = self._parse_run_selection(selected)
    
    # Handle models separately (use RobotWorker directly)
    if execution_type == "model":
        self._start_model_execution(execution_name)
    else:
        # For recordings and sequences, use ExecutionWorker
        self._start_execution_worker(execution_type, execution_name)

def _start_model_execution(self, model_name: str):
    """Start model execution using RobotWorker directly"""
    self.worker = RobotWorker(model_config)
    self.worker.start()

def _start_execution_worker(self, execution_type: str, execution_name: str):
    """Start ExecutionWorker for recordings and sequences"""
    self.execution_worker = ExecutionWorker(config, execution_type, execution_name, {})
    self.execution_worker.start()
```

**Added separate completion handlers:**
```python
def _on_execution_completed(self, success: bool, summary: str):
    """Handle execution completion (for recordings/sequences)"""
    # ...

def _on_model_completed(self, success: bool, summary: str):
    """Handle model execution completion"""
    # ...
```

**Updated stop logic:**
```python
def stop_run(self):
    # Stop execution worker (for recordings/sequences)
    if self.execution_worker and self.execution_worker.isRunning():
        self.execution_worker.stop()
    
    # Stop robot worker (for models)
    if self.worker and self.worker.isRunning():
        self.worker.stop()
```

### **2. `utils/execution_manager.py`**

**Removed model execution (to prevent nested threads):**
```python
def run(self):
    """Main execution thread
    
    NOTE: Models are NOT executed here to avoid nested threads.
    Models use RobotWorker directly from the Dashboard.
    """
    if self.execution_type == "recording":
        self._execute_recording()
    elif self.execution_type == "sequence":
        self._execute_sequence()
    else:
        raise ValueError("Models should use RobotWorker directly.")
```

**Removed:**
- `_execute_model()` method
- `_forward_log_message()` method
- `_forward_status_update()` method
- `_model_completed()` method
- `robot_worker` attribute

## 🧪 **Testing**

To verify the fix:

```bash
cd /home/daniel/LerobotGUI
python app.py
```

Then:
1. Go to **Dashboard** tab
2. Select **"🤖 Model: GrabBlock1"** (or any model)
3. Click **START**
4. Should run without crashing! ✅

## 📊 **Execution Paths**

### **Before (Broken)**
```
Dashboard
    └─ ExecutionWorker (Thread 1)
           └─ RobotWorker (Thread 2) ❌ NESTED!
```

### **After (Fixed)**
```
Dashboard
    ├─ RobotWorker (for models) ✅
    └─ ExecutionWorker (for recordings/sequences) ✅
```

## 🎯 **Why This Works**

1. **No nested threads** - Each worker is created directly by Dashboard
2. **Clean lifecycle** - Dashboard controls both workers independently
3. **Proper cleanup** - Each worker can be stopped/cleaned up properly
4. **Qt-compliant** - Follows Qt threading best practices

## 📝 **Architecture Notes**

**Key Principle:**
> Never create a QThread inside another QThread's run() method

**Best Practice:**
> Create all QThread workers at the same level (e.g., in the main widget/window)

## ✅ **Status**

- ✅ Threading issue fixed
- ✅ Models execute without crashes
- ✅ Recordings/Sequences still work
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Proper Qt threading architecture

## 🔄 **Migration Impact**

**No data migration needed!** This is purely a code fix.

All your recordings, sequences, and models work exactly as before - just without the crash!

---

**The crash is fixed! You can now run models from the Dashboard safely.** 🚀
