# Hand Safety Monitoring System

## Overview

**CRITICAL SAFETY FEATURE**: The hand safety monitoring system uses computer vision to detect hands in the robot workspace and triggers an **EMERGENCY STOP** to prevent injury.

⚠️ **This is NOT a "pause" system - it's an EMERGENCY STOP system that requires manual restart.**

## How It Works

1. **Background Monitoring**: Runs as a lightweight background thread during robot operation
2. **Hand Detection**: Uses MediaPipe (primary) or HSV skin-tone detection (fallback)
3. **Emergency Stop**: Immediately disables motor torque when hand detected
4. **Manual Restart Required**: Operator must manually restart after emergency stop

## Key Features

### Reliable Detection
- **MediaPipe Hands**: Industry-standard hand tracking (most reliable)
- **HSV Fallback**: Skin-tone detection when MediaPipe unavailable
- **Multi-camera Support**: Monitor front, wrist, or both cameras simultaneously

### Resource Efficient
- **Configurable FPS**: Default 8 FPS (lightweight, ~125ms response time)
- **Low Resolution**: 320x240 processing for speed
- **Background Thread**: Non-blocking, runs parallel to robot operations

### Comprehensive Settings
All settings accessible in Settings → Safety tab:
- **Enable/Disable**: Turn monitoring on/off
- **Camera Selection**: front/wrist/both/all
- **Detection FPS**: 1-30 FPS (lower=lighter, 8 recommended)
- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.1-0.9 (0.45 recommended)
- **Resume Delay**: 0.5-10s (time workspace must be clear)
- **Frame Size**: 160-640px width (320 recommended)
- **MediaPipe Toggle**: Enable/disable MediaPipe (fallback to HSV)

## Configuration

Add to `config.json`:

```json
{
  "safety": {
    "enabled": false,
    "cameras": "front",
    "detection_fps": 8.0,
    "frame_width": 320,
    "frame_height": 240,
    "detection_confidence": 0.45,
    "tracking_confidence": 0.35,
    "resume_delay_s": 1.0,
    "skin_threshold": 0.045,
    "use_mediapipe": true
  }
}
```

## Testing

1. Go to **Settings → Safety** tab
2. Configure desired settings
3. Click **🎥 Test Hand Detection**
4. Move your hand in front of camera
5. Verify detection works before enabling for robot operations

## Safety Notes

⚠️ **IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**:

1. **Physical E-Stop Required**: Software safety is NOT sufficient alone. Always have a physical emergency stop button.

2. **Not a Replacement**: This system enhances safety but doesn't replace proper safety protocols, training, and physical safety equipment.

3. **Response Time**: ~125ms at 8 FPS. Slower than physical E-stop but adequate for collaborative operations.

4. **Lighting Conditions**: Works best with good lighting. Test in your actual operating conditions.

5. **False Positives**: Better to have false alarms than miss a hand detection. Adjust sensitivity as needed.

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Module**: `safety/hand_safety.py`
- **Integration**: `utils/execution_manager.py`
- **UI**: `tabs/settings_tab.py`
- **Dependencies**: OpenCV, NumPy, MediaPipe

### Detection Methods

**MediaPipe (Primary)**:
- Google's production-ready hand tracking
- Robust across lighting conditions
- Tracks 21 hand landmarks
- Model complexity: 0 (lightweight)

**HSV Fallback**:
- Skin-tone color segmentation
- No external dependencies
- Less reliable but always available
- Threshold: 4.5% skin pixels

### Integration Points

The safety monitor:
1. Initializes in `ExecutionWorker.__init__()`
2. Starts when robot execution begins
3. Monitors continuously in background thread
4. Triggers `_on_hand_detected()` callback on detection
5. Immediately disables motor torque
6. Stops when robot execution ends

## Troubleshooting

### Monitor Not Starting
- Check "Enable Hand Safety Monitoring" is checked
- Verify cameras configured in Camera tab
- Check mediapipe installed: `pip install mediapipe>=0.10.0`

### Too Many False Positives
- Increase detection confidence (Settings → Safety)
- Reduce frame size for faster processing
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Try front camera only (less background)

### Not Detecting Hands
- Lower detection confidence
- Test camera view with Test button
- Check lighting (too dark/bright affects HSV)
- Verify MediaPipe enabled (more reliable)

### High CPU Usage
- Lower detection FPS (8 → 4 FPS)
- Reduce frame width (320 → 240px)
- Use single camera instead of both
- Disable MediaPipe (use HSV fallback)

## Performance Specs

- **Detection FPS**: 8 Hz (configurable 1-30 Hz)
- **Response Time**: ~125ms (at 8 FPS)
- **CPU Usage**: ~5-10% (single core, depends on FPS)
- **Memory**: ~100-200 MB (MediaPipe model)
- **Camera Resolution**: 320x240 (processing), 640x480 (capture)

## Version History

- **v1.0 (2025-10-23)**: Initial implementation with MediaPipe + HSV fallback, emergency stop integration, comprehensive settings panel
