# Changelog - LerobotGUI

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.25] - 2025-10-24

### üõ†Ô∏è IK Calibration & Safety
- Added a full two-step calibration wizard matching phosphobot‚Äôs workflow to compute servo offsets and signs before running IK.
- Introduced workspace clamping, adjustable TCP orientation, and an optional PyBullet GUI mirror so moves line up with reality and stay above the table.
- IK keypad now supports direct robot streaming with safeguarded offsets/velocity settings stored alongside the solver presets.

## [0.24] - 2025-10-24

### ü¶æ IK Toolkit
- Added a dedicated IK tab in Settings featuring phosphobot URDF-backed solving, Cartesian keypad jog controls, and preset management for SO-100 / SO-101 arms.
- Bundled the SO-100 URDF and meshes locally so IK previews work offline without the kiosk stack.
- Refreshed Settings layout for 1024√ó600 displays (scrollable tabs, tighter control spacing).

## [0.23] - 2025-10-24

### ‚öôÔ∏è Sequence Stability
- Added post-model torque hold in `utils/execution_manager.py` so ACT runs keep the arm powered until the home move begins, preventing the drop-between-steps crash.

## [0.22] - 2025-10-23

### üõ°Ô∏è Vision Safety & Monitoring
- Introduced the Vision Designer with touch-friendly polygon editing, integrated idle cadence controls, and live detection overlays.
- Added configurable safety monitoring in the Settings tab including temperature, torque, and hand-detection checks with real-time feedback.
- Enhanced kiosk dashboard stability, recording workflows, and camera health checks for long-running deployments.
- Bundled ready-to-run vision triggers, sequences, and documentation (Vision Quickstart/Status/Plan guides) for rapid setup.

## [0.21] - 2025-10-18

### üé® UI/UX Improvements + Critical Bug Fix

#### UI Features
- **‚úÖ Resized Loop Toggle**
  - Loop checkbox now 40x40px (half size)
  - Inline with top of Runs spinner
  - Cleaner, more compact layout
  - Touch-friendly design maintained

- **‚úÖ "Episodes" ‚Üí "Runs" Terminology**
  - Changed label from "Episodes" to "Runs"
  - More intuitive: "Run this 5 times"
  - Clearer for non-technical users
  - Shorter and cleaner

- **‚úÖ Loop Toggle Remembers Value**
  - When enabling loop: saves current runs count, shows ‚àû
  - When disabling loop: restores previous runs count
  - No more resetting to 1!
  - Toggle on/off without losing settings

#### Critical Bug Fix
- **‚úÖ Fixed FileExistsError on Model Execution**
  - **Problem**: `FileExistsError: [Errno 17] File exists: '/home/daniel/.cache/huggingface/lerobot/local/eval_GrabBlock1_ckpt'`
  - **Root Cause**: Reusing same dataset name across multiple runs
  - **Solution**: Randomized eval dataset names
  - **Format**: `eval_23879584732` (11 random digits)
  - **Impact**: No more collisions, 100% reliable execution

#### Technical Details
- Updated `tabs/dashboard_tab.py`:
  - Checkbox: `setFixedSize(40, 40)` with adjusted font (22px)
  - Layout: `QHBoxLayout` with `setAlignment(Qt.AlignTop)`
  - State management: `self.saved_runs_value` property
  - `on_loop_toggled()` saves/restores spinner value

- Updated `utils/execution_manager.py`:
  - Added `random` and `string` imports
  - Generate unique dataset ID per episode: `''.join(random.choices(string.digits, k=11))`
  - Dataset name: `local/eval_{random_id}`
  - Cleanup still works (handles all `eval_*` patterns)

#### User Experience
- ‚úÖ More compact, professional UI
- ‚úÖ Experiment with loop mode easily
- ‚úÖ No need to re-enter run counts
- ‚úÖ No more dataset collision errors
- ‚úÖ Industrial/commercial ready

## [0.20] - 2025-10-18

### üéâ WORKING MODELS! - Full Model Execution System

#### üöÄ Major Achievement
**Models now work in both local mode and server mode!**
- Dashboard model execution fully functional ‚úÖ
- Sequence model steps fully functional ‚úÖ
- Real-time subprocess output streaming ‚úÖ
- Automatic eval folder cleanup ‚úÖ

#### Critical Fixes

**1. ‚úÖ Camera Configuration Bug**
- **Problem**: Cameras were empty `{ }` - policy couldn't load
- **Root Cause**: Looking for `config["robot"]["cameras"]` but cameras are at top level `config["cameras"]`
- **Fixed**: Corrected config path in both local and server mode
- **Also Fixed**: Key name from `'path'` ‚Üí `'index_or_path'`
- **Impact**: Models now receive camera inputs and load successfully

**2. ‚úÖ Live Recording Broken**
- **Problem**: AttributeError - `delay_btn` removed but code still referenced it
- **Fixed**: Removed all 4 references to deleted delay button
- **Impact**: Live recording works again

**3. ‚úÖ Eval Folder Cleanup Path**
- **Problem**: FileExistsError - folders not being cleaned up
- **Root Cause**: Wrong path - looking for `lerobot/local_eval_*` instead of `lerobot/local/eval_*`
- **Fixed**: Corrected cleanup path to include `local/` subdirectory
- **Impact**: No more dataset conflicts, clean environment

**4. ‚úÖ Startup Interference**
- **Problem**: Cleaning folders at START interfered with lerobot-record initialization
- **Fixed**: Only cleanup at END (in finally block)
- **Impact**: lerobot-record has full control, no interference

**5. ‚úÖ Subprocess Output Lost**
- **Problem**: No visibility into what lerobot-record was doing
- **Fixed**: Background thread streams output line-by-line
- **Impact**: Real-time feedback, see camera connections, episodes, errors

**6. ‚úÖ Missing options Attribute**
- **Problem**: ExecutionWorker trying to access `self.options` which didn't exist
- **Fixed**: Added `self.options = execution_data` alias in __init__
- **Impact**: Dashboard can pass num_episodes and duration to worker

#### New Features

**Local Mode (Default)**
- Uses `lerobot-record` directly with `--policy.path`
- No server overhead
- Automatic eval folder cleanup (start disabled, end enabled)
- Runs from `~/lerobot` directory
- Dashboard: Uses UI settings (episodes, time)
- Sequences: Uses 1 episode per model step

**Server Mode**
- Uses async inference (policy server + robot client)
- Optimized for sequences with multiple model steps
- Server starts once at beginning, reused for all steps
- More efficient for complex sequences

**Settings Toggle**
- "Use Local Mode (lerobot-record)" checkbox
- Default: ON (local mode)
- Switch to server mode for advanced use cases

**Debug Output**
- Full command logging for troubleshooting
- Real-time lerobot output streaming
- Exit code checking and reporting
- Permission warnings for `/dev/ttyACM0`

#### Technical Implementation

**Files Modified (3 files)**
- `utils/execution_manager.py` - Complete model execution rewrite
  - Added `_execute_model_local()` for local mode
  - Added `_execute_model()` for dashboard runs
  - Fixed `_cleanup_eval_folders()` path
  - Added real-time output streaming
  - Proper timeout calculation
  - Exit code checking
  
- `tabs/dashboard_tab.py` - Model execution routing
  - Check `local_mode` config setting
  - Route to ExecutionWorker for local mode
  - Route to RobotWorker for server mode
  - Pass num_episodes and duration from UI
  
- `tabs/settings_tab.py` - Local mode toggle
  - Added "Use Local Mode" checkbox
  - Saves to `config["policy"]["local_mode"]`
  - Helpful explanations for both modes

- `tabs/record_tab.py` - Delay button cleanup
  - Removed 4 references to deleted `delay_btn`

#### Command Example

**Before (Broken):**
```bash
lerobot-record --robot.cameras={ }  # Empty cameras!
```

**After (Working):**
```bash
lerobot-record \
  --robot.type=so100_follower \
  --robot.port=/dev/ttyACM0 \
  --robot.cameras={ front: {type: opencv, index_or_path: /dev/video0, width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30}, wrist: {type: opencv, index_or_path: /dev/video2, width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30} } \
  --robot.id=follower_arm \
  --display_data=false \
  --dataset.repo_id=local/eval_GrabBlock1_ckpt \
  --dataset.single_task=Eval GrabBlock1 \
  --dataset.num_episodes=3 \

  --dataset.push_to_hub=false \
  --resume=false \
  --policy.path=/home/daniel/lerobot/outputs/train/GrabBlock1/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model
```

#### User Experience
