### üêõ Bug Fix Release

#### Critical Fixes
- **‚úÖ Delete Button Fixed**
  - Fixed Qt lambda issue causing delete button to not work
  - Now passes button reference instead of using sender()
  - Delete functionality fully operational with confirmation dialog

- **‚úÖ Velocity/Speed Separation**
  - Positions now use motor velocity (50-1000) from slider
  - Live recordings use speed percentage (25-200)
  - Column renamed to "Vel/Speed" to reflect dual purpose
  - Proper data structure for saving/loading with correct parameters

- **‚úÖ Removed Defunct Features**
  - Removed "Add Delay" button (delays now part of composite manifest)
  - Cleaned up AttributeError related to add_delay_row
  - Delays will return in future step editor UI

- **‚úÖ Import Fixes**
  - Removed obsolete settings_dialog imports
  - Fixed ModuleNotFoundError on app startup
  - Settings now handled by integrated SettingsTab

#### Technical Improvements
- Added extensive debug logging for troubleshooting
- Improved action table data structure
- Better separation of concerns between position and live recording types
- Enhanced error messages with context

#### Files Modified
- `widgets/action_table.py` - Fixed delete button, velocity/speed handling
- `tabs/record_tab.py` - Velocity from slider, debug logging
- `app.py` - Removed obsolete imports
- `tabs/dashboard_tab.py` - Removed obsolete imports

#### Testing Notes
- Delete button confirmed working with button reference approach
- Velocity slider correctly applies to position recordings
- Speed percentage correctly applies to live recordings

### üéâ Initial Release - Modular Composite Recording System

#### Major Features
- **Modular Composite Recording System**
  - Folder-based storage with manifest.json orchestration
  - Separate component files for live recordings and position sets
  - Per-step speed and delay control
  - Mix live recordings and position waypoints freely

- **Crash Prevention System**
  - Triple-layer safety net (global exception handler, worker protection, cleanup protection)
  - Application never shuts down unexpectedly
  - All errors caught and logged

- **Industrial-Grade Architecture**
  - Individual JSON files for each recording
  - Automatic timestamped backups
  - Safe filename sanitization
  - Robust error handling throughout

#### Core Components
- `utils/recording_component.py` - Base classes for modular components
- `utils/composite_recording.py` - Composite recording manager
- `utils/actions_manager.py` - Folder-based recording management (rewritten)
- `utils/execution_manager.py` - Composite recording execution
- `utils/sequences_manager.py` - Sequence management with backups

#### UI Features
- Dashboard Tab - Execute models, recordings, and sequences
- Record Tab - Capture live motions and position waypoints
- Sequence Tab - Build complex multi-step workflows
- Settings Tab - Configure robot, cameras, and policies

#### Bug Fixes
- ‚úÖ Fixed `KeyError: 'positions'` when saving live recordings
- ‚úÖ Fixed live record button becoming inactive after first use
- ‚úÖ Fixed nested QThread crash when running models
- ‚úÖ Fixed recordings not appearing in Dashboard after save
- ‚úÖ Fixed data loss bug - live recordings now preserve all points

#### Technical Details
- Python 3.13 + PySide6 (Qt6)
- LeRobot integration for SO-100/SO-101 arms
- Sydney timezone support
- Robust file system operations with backups

#### Known Limitations
- No backward compatibility with pre-0.01 single-file recordings
- Requires fresh start with new composite format
- Designed for Linux (tested on Ubuntu)
