# 🎉 Sequencer Rebuild Complete!

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Branch:** `dev`  
**Commit:** `d1bf9bf`

---

## ✅ Implementation Summary

The sequencer has been **completely rebuilt** with a robust, modular, folder-based architecture. All 5 phases of the rebuild plan have been successfully implemented.

---

## 🏗️ What Was Built

### **Phase 1: Home Step Type** ✅
- **+Home Button** added to Sequence tab UI
- New **home step type** returns arm Home
- Visual feedback with 🏠 icon and green color
- Integrated into ExecutionManager with `_execute_home_inline()`

### **Phase 2: Sequence Execution Wiring** ✅
- **Signal connection**: `SequenceTab` → `DashboardTab`
- **RUN SEQUENCE button** now triggers ExecutionWorker
- Full **progress and status feedback** during execution
- Stop button works mid-sequence

### **Phase 3: CompositeSequence Classes** ✅
**New Files:**
- `utils/sequence_step.py` - Base classes for all step types:
  - `ActionStep` - Execute saved recordings
  - `ModelStep` - Run trained policy models
  - `DelayStep` - Wait for duration
  - `HomeStep` - Return Home
  
- `utils/composite_sequence.py` - Folder-based sequence management:
  - Manifest orchestration
  - Individual step files
  - Add/remove/reorder steps
  - Save/load/delete operations

### **Phase 4: SequencesManager Rewrite** ✅
- **Folder-based storage**: `data/sequences/{sequence_name}/`
  - `manifest.json` - Orchestration and metadata
  - `01_step_name_action.json` - Individual step files
  - `02_step_name_delay.json`
  - etc.
  
- **Automatic backups** of entire sequence folders
- **Backward compatible** loading (converts to UI format)
- Clean, maintainable code

### **Phase 5: ExecutionManager Updates** ✅
- **Fixed type mismatch**: Changed `"recording"` → `"action"`
- **Model execution implemented**: `_execute_model_inline()`
  - Starts policy server and robot client as subprocesses
  - Runs for specified duration
  - Graceful shutdown with timeout
  - Respects stop requests
  
- **Helper methods** for building server/client commands
- **Robust error handling** throughout

## 🎯 New Features

### Sequence Capabilities
1. ✅ **Action Steps** - Execute saved recordings
2. ✅ **Model Steps** - Run trained policies with duration control
3. ✅ **Delay Steps** - Wait for specified time
4. ✅ **Home Steps** - Return Home (NEW!)
5. ✅ **Loop Mode** - Repeat sequence indefinitely
6. ✅ **Stop Control** - Stop mid-execution

### Architecture Improvements

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

**⚠️ Requires Physical Robot Hardware**

The following tests need to be performed with the actual SO-100/101 robot:

### Test 1: Basic Sequence (Action + Delay)
1. Record 2 actions in Record tab
2. Go to Sequence tab
3. Add Action → Select first action
4. Add Delay → 2 seconds
5. Add Action → Select second action
6. Save sequence
7. Click RUN SEQUENCE
8. **Verify**: Actions execute in order with delay

### Test 2: Home Step
1. Create sequence with:
   - Action
   - Home
   - Action
2. Run sequence
3. **Verify**: Arm returns Home between actions

### Test 3: Loop Mode
1. Create simple sequence (2 steps)
2. Enable Loop toggle
3. Run sequence
4. **Verify**: Sequence repeats continuously
5. Press STOP
6. **Verify**: Stops cleanly

### Test 4: Model in Sequence
1. Create sequence with:
   - Action (position arm)
   - Model (trained policy, 10s duration)
   - Home
2. Run sequence
3. **Verify**: Model executes for specified time, then continues

### Test 5: Stop Mid-Execution
1. Create long sequence (5+ steps)
2. Run sequence
3. Press STOP during execution
4. **Verify**: Stops immediately, arm safe

5. Click **🤖 Model** to add policy execution
6. Click **🏠 Home** to return Home
7. Drag steps to reorder
8. Select step and click **🗑️ Delete** to remove
9. Toggle **🔁 Loop** if needed
