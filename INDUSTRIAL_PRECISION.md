## 📋 Table Structure: ONE Action Per Row

### New Table Columns
| Action Name | Type | Speed % | Delete |
|-------------|------|---------|--------|
| Editable name | 📍 Position OR 🔴 Recording | 25-200% | 🗑️ |

### Action Types

#### 1. 📍 **Single Position**
- ONE precise waypoint
- 6-axis motor positions
- Speed % controls movement velocity
- Perfect for: waypoints, pick/place endpoints

#### 2. 🔴 **Live Recording**
- ONE complete recorded motion
- Multiple points with timestamps
- Stored internally as ONE contained action
- Perfect for: complex trajectories, organic movements

## 🔴 Live Recording System

### Capture Specifications
- **Recording Rate**: 20Hz (50ms intervals) - INDUSTRIAL GRADE
- **Position Threshold**: 3 units minimum change - HIGH PRECISION
- **Timestamp Precision**: Millisecond-level accuracy
- **Data Structure**: Each point stores:
  ```python
  {
      'positions': [6 motor positions],
      'timestamp': float (seconds from start),
      'velocity': int (motor speed)
  }
  ```

### How It Works
1. **Start**: Click "🔴 LIVE RECORD" (far right)
2. **Move Arm**: Positions captured automatically at 20Hz
3. **Filtering**: Only records when position changes >3 units
4. **Stop**: Creates ONE table row with entire recording
5. **Result**: Complete action ready for precision playback

### Benefits
- ✅ **High Sample Rate**: 20Hz captures smooth motion
- ✅ **Intelligent Filtering**: No redundant data (3-unit threshold)
- ✅ **Timestamp Accuracy**: Precise timing for replay
- ✅ **Data Efficiency**: Only significant changes recorded
- ✅ **ONE Action**: Entire recording is single contained unit

## ⚡ Speed % System

### Per-Action Speed Control
- **Range**: 25% - 200%
- **Location**: Speed % column in table (editable)
- **Application**: Each action can have different speed
- **Precision**: Industrial-grade velocity scaling

### Speed Scaling Math
```
Single Position:
  velocity = 600 * (speed / 100)
  
  Examples:
  - 50%: velocity = 300
  - 100%: velocity = 600
  - 200%: velocity = 1200

Live Recording:
  velocity = recorded_velocity * (speed / 100)
  timestamp = recorded_timestamp * (100 / speed)
  
  Examples:
  - 50% speed: 2x slower, timestamps doubled
  - 200% speed: 2x faster, timestamps halved
```

## 🎯 Playback System

### Industrial Precision Execution

#### Single Position Playback
```python
1. Convert speed % to velocity
2. Send position command with calculated velocity
3. WAIT for position verification (±7 unit tolerance)
4. Confirm arrival before next action
5. Keep connection alive for smooth transitions
```

#### Live Recording Playback
```python
1. Time-based interpolation with 1ms precision
2. Calculate target times: timestamp * (100/speed)
3. Send position commands at exact timestamps
4. Real-time progress updates (every 10 points)
5. Speed scaling applied to both timing AND velocity
6. Maintains recording timing accuracy
```

### Key Features
- **Position Verification**: Confirms arrival within ±7 units
- **Time Synchronization**: 1ms precision timing loops
- **Connection Management**: Keeps torque on between actions
- **Progress Feedback**: Real-time % complete for recordings
- **Loop Mode**: Continuous operation with no torque drops

## 🎓 Best Practices

### Recording
1. **Move Slowly**: Smoother data, better playback
2. **Test First**: Record at slow speed, play at fast speed
3. **Verify**: Check recording point count makes sense
4. **Name Clearly**: Use descriptive action names

### Playback
1. **Start Slow**: Test at 50% speed first
2. **Verify Positions**: Check waypoints individually
3. **Loop Test**: Run 5-10 loops before production
4. **Monitor**: Watch for position drift over time

### Speed Selection
- **25-50%**: Testing, debugging, complex tasks
- **75-100%**: Normal operation
- **125-150%**: Faster production (if safe)
- **175-200%**: High-speed (verify thoroughly)

## 🔬 Calibration & Maintenance

### Initial Calibration
1. Record home position
2. Test single waypoint accuracy
3. Record test pattern
4. Verify repeatability (10+ runs)
5. Adjust threshold if needed

### Regular Maintenance
- Check position accuracy weekly
- Verify motor torque monthly
- Clean encoder sensors
- Update firmware as needed
- Review error logs

### Troubleshooting
| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Position drift | Mechanical wear | Recalibrate, check torque |
| Jerky motion | Too few points | Lower threshold (2 units) |
| Slow capture | CPU overload | Reduce to 10Hz |
| Timing errors | System load | Dedicated Jetson core |

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- **Position Error**: Actual vs target (should be <7 units)
- **Timing Deviation**: Actual vs expected timestamps
- **Success Rate**: % of successful completions
- **Cycle Time**: Total time per action
- **CPU Usage**: Should be <30% on Jetson

### Logging
```
[LIVE RECORD] Point 47: t=2.350s, Δ=5 units
[PLAYBACK] Single position, speed=100%, velocity=600
[PLAYBACK] ✓ Position reached
[MOTOR] ✓ Position reached in 0.85s (max error: 4 units)
```
