CAMERA DEVICE SETTING
---------------------

You can specify the camera device in TWO ways:

1. 🔢 INTEGER INDEX (e.g., 0, 1, 2)
   - Simple index number
   - Example: 0, 1, 2, 3
   - OpenCV automatically maps to /dev/video{N}
   - 0 → /dev/video0
   - 1 → /dev/video1
   - 2 → /dev/video2

2. 📂 FULL PATH (e.g., "/dev/video0", "/dev/video2")
   - Complete device path
   - Example: "/dev/video0", "/dev/video2", "/dev/video4"
   - More explicit, works the same way
   - Use this if you have specific device requirements

THEY ARE EQUIVALENT!
--------------------

These are THE SAME:
✓ 0           = /dev/video0
✓ 1           = /dev/video1
✓ 2           = /dev/video2
✓ 3           = /dev/video3

WHICH ONE TO USE?
-----------------

Use INTEGER (0, 1, 2) when:
✓ You don't care about the exact device path
✓ You want cleaner config
✓ Your cameras are in order (video0, video1, video2, etc.)

Use PATH ("/dev/video2") when:
✓ You want to be explicit
✓ Your cameras are NOT sequential (e.g., video0, video2, video6)
✓ You're using USB cameras that might change order on reboot

EXAMPLE CONFIG
--------------

Option 1: Using integer indices
```json
{
  "cameras": {
    "front": {
      "type": "opencv",
      "index_or_path": 0,
      "width": 640,
      "height": 480,
      "fps": 30
    },
    "wrist": {
      "type": "opencv",
      "index_or_path": 2,
      "width": 640,
      "height": 480,
      "fps": 30
    }
  }
}
```

Option 2: Using full paths (SAME RESULT!)
```json
{
  "cameras": {
    "front": {
      "type": "opencv",
      "index_or_path": "/dev/video0",
      "width": 640,
      "height": 480,
      "fps": 30
    },
    "wrist": {
      "type": "opencv",
      "index_or_path": "/dev/video2",
      "width": 640,
      "height": 480,
      "fps": 30
    }
  }
}
```

Option 3: Mixed (also works!)
```json
{
  "cameras": {
    "front": {
      "type": "opencv",
      "index_or_path": 0,           ← integer
      "width": 640,
      "height": 480,
      "fps": 30
    },
    "wrist": {
      "type": "opencv",
      "index_or_path": "/dev/video2", ← path
      "width": 640,
      "height": 480,
      "fps": 30
    }
  }
}
```

YOUR CURRENT SETUP
------------------
Based on your config, you have:
- front: 0 (which is /dev/video0)
- wrist: "/dev/video2" (which is /dev/video2)

Both work perfectly! No need to change unless you want consistency.

HOW THE GUI HANDLES IT
-----------------------
When you open Settings → Cameras:
✓ The dropdown shows available /dev/video* devices
✓ You can type an integer (0, 1, 2) or a path (/dev/video0)
✓ When saving, it auto-converts:
  - Pure numbers (no slash) → integer
  - Paths with slash → string path

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
For consistency and clarity, I'd suggest:
👉 Use INTEGER for built-in/CSI cameras (0, 1)
👉 Use PATH for USB cameras that might move (/dev/video2, /dev/video4)

But honestly, BOTH WORK THE SAME! 🎉

CHECK YOUR CAMERAS
------------------
To see what cameras you have:
```bash
ls -l /dev/video*
```

Example output:
```
/dev/video0  ← Built-in camera
/dev/video1  ← Built-in camera metadata
/dev/video2  ← USB camera 1
/dev/video3  ← USB camera 1 metadata
/dev/video4  ← USB camera 2
```

Usually the actual video devices are even numbers (0, 2, 4).
The odd numbers (1, 3, 5) are metadata devices.

FINAL ANSWER
------------
Your current setup with "0" and "/dev/video2" is PERFECT! ✅
No need to change anything. Both formats work identically.
